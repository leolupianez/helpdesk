## How It's Made:
This project is a web-based help desk and support ticket management system built with Next.js, styled with TailwindCSS, and integrated with Supabase for backend services. It enables users to submit support ticket requests and allows support staff to manage these tickets efficiently.

- **Admin Panel:** A separate backend interface for staff to view a summary of all tickets, with features to respond to requests and update ticket statuses.
- **Ticket Status Management:** Support staff can update the status of each ticket, with possible statuses including *new*, *in progress*, and *resolved*.
- **Staff Roles:** There are distinct roles for staff, including Support, Manager, and Admin.
  - **Support:** Handles day-to-day ticket resolution.
  - **Manager:** Oversees ticket management and support operations.
  - **Admin:** Possesses full system access, including the ability to add or manage other staff members.
